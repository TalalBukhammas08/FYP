# FYP
MATLAB code to analyse the flutter behaviour of panels under supersonic flow.
<br> Currently, First Order Shear Deformation Theory and First Order Piston Theory are utilised to model structural and aerodynamics respectively. The geometry is modelled with 8 noded quadratic quadrilateral elements.

<br>The project is planned to be ported to Python. Once this is done, documentation will be completed. In the meantime, I refer to [my Masters paper submission](https://github.com/TalalBukhammas08/FYP/blob/main/Documentation/Masters%20FYP.pdf).
